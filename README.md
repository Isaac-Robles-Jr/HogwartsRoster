# HogwartsDirectory
IST 261 Final Project - HogwartsDirectory (Formaly HogwartsRoster)
Final Project for IST 261 in Penn State - University Park
This project allows user to interact with a Java GUI to add, edit, and delete users.
Using the Java GUI, the user can select the users they wish to perform these actions on and see it update accordingly.
To add a spin on the project, it was decided to use a theme of Harry Potter and the various students as examples.
